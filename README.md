**Credit Card Fraud Detection Project**

Welcome to the official repository of the ongoing Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This initiative is a personal endeavor undertaken to explore and evaluate cutting-edge techniques in the field, incorporating insights from the latest research in 2023. Additionally, experimental and innovative approaches developed through self-guided exploration may also be introduced.

### Project Progress:

- **Literature Review:** A comprehensive review of relevant literature forms the foundation of this project. We delve into the latest advancements and methodologies to ensure alignment with the forefront of research.

- **Basic Project Structure:** The initial stages involve establishing a basic project structure, laying the groundwork for the implementation of various fraud detection techniques.

### What to Expect:

This repository is actively evolving as I progress through different phases of the project. I encourage collaboration, feedback, and contributions from the community to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of our fraud detection methods.

### Key Features:

- **Comparative Analysis:** I aim to compare and contrast different fraud detection techniques, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Incorporating New Research:** Stay tuned for updates as I integrate findings from the latest research conducted in 2023, ensuring our methods are state-of-the-art.

- **Experimental Approaches:** Alongside established techniques, I explore novel, experimental approaches to push the boundaries of credit card fraud detection.

### Current Status:

The repository is currently in active development under my individual effort, guided by my professor. Your involvement and feedback are crucial to the success of this project. Feel free to explore, contribute, and be a part of the journey towards more secure financial transactions.

Thank you for your interest in the Credit Card Fraud Detection Project!
